# OpenClaw - Changelog and History of Changes

## 2026-02-20
*   **Indentation Standard**: Enforced a strict 3-space indentation rule across all `.prg` files to ensure consistent code formatting.
*   **Web Search Skill**: Implemented `websearch.prg` to search the web using DuckDuckGo via `hbcurl`.
*   **Syntax Corrections**: 
    *   Fixed `At()` function calls in Harbour 3.0+ to use `hb_At()` when specifying a start position.
    *   Corrected Hash Map syntax error from using `:` to the native `=>` operator.
*   **Keyword Standards**: Updated `SKILL.md` to strictly enforce the use of the full `return` keyword instead of the abbreviated `retu`. Replaced all instances of `retu` with `return` across all `.prg` files.
*   **Variables Spacing**: Updated `SKILL.md` to require one blank line after `local` variable definitions. Applied this formatting rule across all `.prg` files.
*   **Language Standards**: Updated `SKILL.md` rules requiring all comments within `.prg` files to be written in English. Ran a script to translate all existing Spanish comments.
*   **Function and Local Spacing**: Updated `SKILL.md` to require exactly one blank line after `function` declarations (before `local` variables) and another after `local` variables block. Ran formatter to apply this across all `.prg` files.
*   **Expression Formatting**: Updated `SKILL.md` to mandate a space after the logical NOT operator (`! `) and spaces inside parentheses (`( ... )`).
*   **General Behavior**: Created a new `SKILL.md` under `general_behavior` to systematically enforce the cleanup of temporary `.py` and `.html` workspace files, maintaining directory integrity.
*   **Context Optimization**: Refactored `aios.prg` to disable redundant injection of `MEMORY.md` into the dynamic system prompt, eliminating the AI repeating full conversational history.
*   **Chat HTML UI Formatting**: Fixed the UI line-break rendering bug in `chat.prg` by implementing a split/join strategy to reliably convert textual `\n` carriage returns into HTML `<br>` tags alongside setting `white-space: pre-wrap`.
*   **AI Persona**: Reviewed and activated the AI persona skill (`IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`), confirming automatic integration with AI responses.
*   **Dual Web Search**: Refactored the `web_search` skill to support dual searching due to DuckDuckGo CAPTCHA blocks. Integrated Wikipedia JSON extraction for encyclopedic searches (`websearch_wiki.prg`), and Google Serper API extraction via `serper_config.json` for live web searches (`websearch.prg`).
*   **Token Pricing and Counting**: Included logic in `aios.prg` and `chat.prg` to visually track the execution cost and number of tokens consumed by standard API usage. Resolved Harbour string syntax parsing errors inside Javascript templates.
*   **Version Control**: Reset ultra-stable version tracking from 1.7 back to standard 1.0 release branch across all core scripts.
